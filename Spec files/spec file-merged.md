## 1. Business Context

The Banking API is the core service for managing customer accounts and monetary operations within a retail banking platform. It exposes a REST interface consumed by a web frontend and, where authorised, by internal back-office tooling. Two categories of caller interact with the API: customers who manage their own data, and administrators who have elevated, unrestricted access across all resources.

The platform covers the full customer lifecycle:

- **Authentication and identity** (Group 1): Registration, login, JWT issuance, customer profile management.
- **Accounts and transactions** (Group 2): Account creation, balance operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer), account lifecycle management.
- **Extended banking features** (Group 3): Transaction history, standing orders, notification evaluation, monthly statements, and spending insights.

---

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This specification defines the Banking API as the single source of truth for contract generation and implementation alignment. It covers all operations across all three groups:

**Group 1 — Auth & Customer**
1. Register (US-101)
2. Login (US-102)
3. Create Customer (US-103)
4. Update Customer (US-104)
5. Get Customer (US-105)
6. List All Customers — Admin only (AD-001, implementation-derived)

**Group 2 — Accounts & Monetary Operations**
7. Delete Customer
8. Create Account
9. Retrieve Account Details
10. List Customer Accounts
11. Update Account
12. Delete Account
13. Deposit
14. Withdraw
15. Transfer Funds

**Group 3 — Extended Features**
16. Get Transaction History (US-08)
17. Standing Order Management (US-09)
18. Evaluate Notification Event (US-10)
19. Get Monthly Statement (US-11)
20. Spending Insights (US-12)

### Development Perspective

- **Backend:** Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.x (`Web`, `Data JPA`, `Validation`, `Security`, `Actuator`)
- **Frontend:** React 18 with JavaScript, React Query v5, Axios, and Vite
- **Runtime persistence:** H2 file-based (`./data/digitalbankdb`) for current environment
- **Authentication:** Stateless JWT (HS256), validated by Spring Security filter on every protected request
- **API documentation:** SpringDoc / Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`; OpenAPI JSON at `/v3/api-docs/**`
- Treat all statements using MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, and NOT ALLOWED as normative.
- Operation-specific statements take precedence over general cross-cutting statements when they are more specific.

### QA Perspective

- Use this document as the basis for traceable test coverage.
- For every operation verify: request/response contract, security behaviour, state change, and required persisted side effects.
- Acceptance criteria are the minimum regression set and should be extended with boundary, negative, and authorization scenarios.

---

## 3. Clarifications and Decisions

### Session 2026-04-02

- Q: Should failed monetary operations be persisted as transactions? → **A:** Yes, persist transactions for both SUCCESS and FAILED for Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer.
- Q: How should concurrent money-movement conflicts be handled? → **A:** Allow concurrent operations; whichever commits first wins silently.
- Q: How should duplicate retries be handled for monetary operations? → **A:** Require idempotency for Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer so retried identical requests return the original outcome.
- Q: What is the API security baseline? → **A:** All endpoints require authenticated caller; account/customer operations allowed only on resources the caller is authorized to access.
- Q: What are the monetary currency and precision rules? → **A:** All monetary amounts are in one system currency with scale=2.

### Session 2026-04-06

- Q: Should this API persist internal user data in addition to external identity? → **A:** Yes. The API persists a local user record linked to the external identity subject.
- Q: Are admin role grant/revoke actions in scope? → **A:** Yes, admin role-management capability is in scope.
- Q: What validation applies to `interestRate` on savings accounts? → **A:** `interestRate` must be a non-negative decimal with at most 4 decimal places.

---

## 4. Architecture Overview

Group 1 owns the **auth and customer layer**. Group 2 owns accounts and monetary operations. Group 3 owns transaction history, standing orders, notifications, statements, and spending insights. The JWT issued by Group 1 is validated on every protected request across all groups.

```

                                  /standing-orders/{standingOrderId}
                                  /notifications/evaluate
                                  /accounts/{id}/statements/{period}
                                  /accounts/{id}/insights
                                  /accounts/{id}/transactions/{txId}/category
```

> **Cross-team dependency:** `customerId` generated by `POST /api/customers` is the foreign key for every Group 2 and Group 3 account operation. All teams use the same `Long` type and auto-increment strategy.

## 5. Shared Definitions

### 5.1 Domain Objects

#### User

Represents an authenticated actor with a local application record linked to an external identity subject.

- `userId` — UUID, system-generated unique identifier. Immutable. Auto-generated via `@PrePersist`
- `username` — string, lowercase email format, unique, stored as-is. Valid email format enforced at registration
- `passwordHash` — BCrypt hash. Never stored plain. **Never returned in any response, log, or error**
- `externalSubjectId` — string. Links this record to the external Identity Provider JWT subject claim
- `customerId` — long, optional. Foreign key linking this user to their Customer record. Null for admin-only users
- `roles` — list of `RoleName` enum values (`CUSTOMER`, `ADMIN`). Defaults to `[CUSTOMER]` on registration. Stored in `user_roles` join table
- `isActive` — boolean. `true` on registration. `false` = login rejected with `403 ACCOUNT_INACTIVE`
- `createdAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, set by `@PrePersist`, immutable
- `updatedAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, set by `@PreUpdate`

> **Implementation note:** The `User` entity uses UUID primary key (`user_id`) stored in a `users` table. Roles are stored as `RoleName` enum strings in a `user_roles` collection table.

#### Customer

Represents a person or company that holds banking accounts.

- `customerId` — long, auto-incremented primary key. Cannot be supplied by caller
- `name` — string, minimum 2 characters, not blank
- `address` — string, not blank
- `type` — enum, `PERSON` or `COMPANY`
- `accounts` — list of `Account` objects (managed by Group 2 / Group 3). Starts empty
- `createdAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, immutable
- `updatedAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, refreshed on every update

**Immutability rule:** `email` and `accountNumber` on a customer are permanently immutable after creation. Any `PATCH /api/customers/{customerId}` request that includes either field must be rejected with `400 FIELD_NOT_UPDATABLE` before any DB call, even if other fields are valid.

#### Account

A customer-held banking product. Account type is immutable after creation.

- `accountId` — long, system-generated unique identifier. Used as the path parameter in all account-level endpoints
- `customerId` (via `customer` relationship) — long, foreign key linking this account to its owning Customer
- `accountType` — enum, `CHECKING` or `SAVINGS`. **Immutable after creation**
- `status` — enum, `ACTIVE` or `CLOSED`. Newly created accounts MUST be `ACTIVE`
- `balance` — `BigDecimal` at exactly two decimal places
- `interestRate` — `BigDecimal`, Savings accounts only. Non-negative, at most 4 decimal places. Not present on CHECKING accounts
- `accountNumber` — string, system-generated account number string *(implementation-derived; not in original specs)*
- `dailyTransferLimit` — `BigDecimal`, default `3000.00`. Applied to standing orders and transfer operations *(implementation-derived)*
- `version` — long, optimistic locking version field managed by JPA `@Version` *(implementation-derived)*
- `deletedAt` — `Instant`, set when account is soft-deleted *(implementation-derived)*
- `closedAt` — `Instant`, set when account status transitions to `CLOSED` *(implementation-derived)*
- `createdAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, set at creation
- `updatedAt` — `Instant`, system-managed, updated on each change

> **Note:** The `nextCheckNumber` field mentioned in the Group 3 spec **is not implemented** in the current Account entity. It is out of scope for this release.

- `amount` — `BigDecimal` at exactly two decimal places. Must be greater than zero
- `direction` — enum, `CREDIT`, `DEBIT`, or `TRANSFER`. Determines the nature of the monetary operation. Note: the implementation uses `TransactionDirection` (`CREDIT`/`DEBIT`/`TRANSFER`) whereas some spec sections describe a `type` field (`DEPOSIT`/`WITHDRAW`/`TRANSFER`). The normative model is `direction` per the implementation
- `status` — enum, `PENDING`, `SUCCESS`, or `FAILED`

---

## 6. Role-Based Access Control

### Overview

- Users are assigned one or more roles.
- Roles are composed of one or more permissions.
- Each API endpoint MUST define one or more required permissions.
- Access is granted if `required_permissions ⊆ user.permissions`.
- Permission checks and ownership checks are **independent** requirements. Both must pass.

### Permissions

> **Implementation note — permission format mismatch:** The `Permission` enum in the codebase defines only four underscore-format values: `CUSTOMER_CREATE`, `CUSTOMER_READ`, `CUSTOMER_UPDATE`, `CUSTOMER_DELETE`. Group 2 (Account/Monetary) endpoints do not use the `Permission` enum — they perform ownership and role checks directly in the service layer. Group 3 endpoints reuse the Group 1 permission strings or perform role-based checks. The colon-format permission names from the original specs (`SO:CREATE`, `STATEMENT:READ`, etc.) are **not implemented** in the `Permission` enum and are not enforced by Spring Security annotations.

| Permission (codebase) | Description | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| `CUSTOMER_CREATE` | Create a customer profile | `@PreAuthorize` on `POST /api/customers`; also reused by `StandingOrderService.create()` |
| `CUSTOMER_READ` | Read a customer profile | `@PreAuthorize` on `GET /api/customers/{id}`; also reused by `TransactionHistoryService`, `MonthlyStatementService`, `StandingOrderService.list()` |
| `CUSTOMER_UPDATE` | Modify a customer profile | `@PreAuthorize` on `PATCH /api/customers/{id}`; also reused by `StandingOrderService.cancel()` |
| `CUSTOMER_DELETE` | Delete a customer profile | Granted to `ADMIN` only; no `@PreAuthorize` on delete endpoint — admin-role check used instead |

### Default Role Permissions

Granted by `CustomUserPrincipal.buildAuthorities()` at authentication time:

#### CUSTOMER
`ROLE_CUSTOMER` + `CUSTOMER_CREATE` + `CUSTOMER_READ` + `CUSTOMER_UPDATE`

#### ADMIN
`ROLE_ADMIN` + `CUSTOMER_CREATE` + `CUSTOMER_READ` + `CUSTOMER_UPDATE` + `CUSTOMER_DELETE`

### Endpoint Permission Matrix

> Enforcement method: **`@PreAuthorize`** = Spring Security annotation on controller; **Service layer** = role/ownership check inside service class using `SecurityContextHolder` or `CustomUserPrincipal`.

| Method | Endpoint | Actual Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Public |
| `POST` | `/api/customers` | `@PreAuthorize`: `hasAuthority('CUSTOMER_CREATE') or hasRole('ADMIN')` |
| `PATCH` | `/api/customers/{customerId}` | `@PreAuthorize`: `hasAuthority('CUSTOMER_UPDATE') and @ownershipService.canAccessCustomer(...)` or `hasRole('ADMIN')` |
| `GET` | `/api/customers/{customerId}` | `@PreAuthorize`: `hasAuthority('CUSTOMER_READ') and @ownershipService.canAccessCustomer(...)` or `hasRole('ADMIN')` |
| `GET` | `/api/customers` | `@PreAuthorize`: `hasRole('ADMIN')` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/customers/{customerId}` | `@PreAuthorize`: `hasRole('ADMIN')` |
| `POST` | `/customers/{customerId}/accounts` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check (CUSTOMER own customer, ADMIN any) |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check |
| `GET` | `/customers/{customerId}/accounts` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check |
| `PUT` | `/accounts/{accountId}` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check |
| `DELETE` | `/accounts/{accountId}` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check (CUSTOMER can delete own zero-balance account) |
| `POST` | `/accounts/{accountId}/deposit` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check |
| `POST` | `/accounts/{accountId}/withdraw` | Service layer: authenticated user + ownership check |
| `POST` | `/accounts/transfer` | Service layer: authenticated user + source account ownership check |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_READ")` + ownership check |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/export` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_READ")` + ownership check |
| `POST` | `/accounts/{accountId}/standing-orders` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_CREATE")` + ownership check |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}/standing-orders` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_READ")` + ownership check |
| `DELETE` | `/standing-orders/{standingOrderId}` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_UPDATE")` + ownership check |
| `POST` | `/notifications/evaluate` | `ServiceApiKeyFilter` (separate security chain — API key, not JWT) |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}/statements/{period}` | Service layer: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_READ")` + ownership check |
| `GET` | `/accounts/{accountId}/insights` | Service layer: `hasInsightsReadAccess` = `INSIGHTS:READ` OR `CUSTOMER_READ` OR `ROLE_ADMIN` + ownership check |
| `PUT` | `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions/{transactionId}/category` | Service layer: `hasInsightsReadAccess` = `INSIGHTS:READ` OR `CUSTOMER_READ` OR `ROLE_ADMIN` + ownership check |

### Authorization Rules

- Group 1 (`/api/customers/**`) uses Spring Security `@PreAuthorize` with `hasAuthority()` and `hasRole()` expressions
- Group 2 (account and monetary operations) has **no** `@PreAuthorize` annotations; all authorization is done in the service layer via `SecurityContextHolder` and an admin/ownership role check
- Group 3 (transactions, standing orders, statements, insights) has **no** `@PreAuthorize` annotations; authorization done in service layer using `CustomUserPrincipal` authorities
- If a caller is not authenticated (no valid JWT) → `401 UNAUTHORISED`
- If ownership validation fails for a CUSTOMER caller → `401 UNAUTHORISED`
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership checks — a `401` for ownership is never returned to ADMIN
- Role assignments MUST be persisted. Only ADMIN may grant or revoke roles

### JWT Authorization Filter

## 8. Data Storage Principles

- Core business records MUST be stored in persistent server-side data stores and MUST NOT rely on in-memory-only storage.
- Customer, account, user-role assignment, and transaction records MUST be stored as structured operational data.
- Audit logs MUST be stored separately from normal operational records in append-only durable storage.
- Idempotency records MUST be stored in durable storage for their configured retention window (default 72 hours) so repeated requests can be detected reliably across restarts.
- Deleted resources MUST be removed from normal operational access while their retained records remain stored for audit and regulatory purposes.
- The system MUST be able to retrieve retained records for audit, legal, regulatory, and support purposes throughout the required retention period.
- **Current implementation:** H2 file-based database (`jdbc:h2:file:./data/digitalbankdb`). H2 in-memory is NOT used in this environment.

---

## 9. Data Retention and Audit Policy

- Financial transaction records and customer/account data MUST be retained for **7 years**.
- This 7-year period satisfies the CRA 6-year requirement plus a 1-year buffer, and meets the FINTRAC 5-year minimum.
  - FINTRAC reference: https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/recordkeeping-document/record/fin-eng
- Audit logs MUST be retained for at least 7 years and MUST NOT be modified or deleted during the retention period.
- Transaction records SHOULD be treated as immutable once written. All transaction records (SUCCESS and FAILED) MUST be retained and MUST NOT be deleted.
- "Delete" operations remove the resource from normal operational use; underlying records remain stored.
- Idempotency keys MAY be retained for 24 to 72 hours and MAY be purged thereafter. Purging idempotency data MUST NOT affect transaction, customer/account, or audit log retention.
- Export cache entries (PDF caches) are purged after 72 hours via the `IdempotencyPurgeJob`. This purge MUST NOT affect retained transaction or statement records.
- Statement originals must never be overwritten. Corrections create a new version with an incremented version number.
- Personal data MUST be retained only as long as necessary per PIPEDA Principle 5.

---

## 10. Cross-Cutting Validation and Error Semantics

- All endpoints require authenticated callers except `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login`.
- `CUSTOMER` callers may use only the explicitly allowed self-service features, and only on resources they own.
- `ADMIN` callers bypass ownership checks and may use all operations.
- All monetary amounts are expressed in a single system currency and MUST use scale=2.
- Error responses for `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `410`, and `422` use the shared `ErrorResponse` schema.

| Status Code | Use It When |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed syntax, type mismatch, invalid path param format, immutable field in body |
| `401` | No valid token; CUSTOMER attempts admin-only op; caller lacks required permission; ownership failure |
| `403` | Authenticated but account is inactive; cancellation within 24-hour standing order lock window |
| `404` | Resource does not exist, or exists as a retained record but is no longer in normal operational use (e.g. `status=CLOSED`) |
| `409` | Business-state conflict (insufficient funds, delete blocked by active accounts, duplicate idempotency, period not yet closed) |
| `410` | Statement beyond self-service retention window |
| `422` | Well-formed but semantically invalid input (negative amount, incompatible field combination, unknown enum value) |
| `200` / `201` | Success with resource representation |

---

## 11. Implementation Infrastructure

This section documents components found in the implementation that are not explicitly described in any of the three original spec files.

### 11.1 JWT Configuration

```
jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET:ThisIsADevOnlySecretKeyForHs256JwtTokenMinimum32Chars}
jwt.access-token-expiry=3600       // seconds (1 hour)
jwt.refresh-token-expiry=604800    // seconds (7 days)
```

- JWT payload carries: `sub` (userId UUID), `roles` (list), `exp`, `iat`
- Algorithm: HS256
- The dev fallback secret MUST NOT be used in production. Production MUST set `JWT_SECRET` via environment variable

### 11.2 Security Filter Chain

Implemented in `SecurityConfig`:

- CSRF disabled (stateless API)
- CORS enabled via `CorsConfig`
- Session management: `STATELESS`
- Public endpoints: `/api/auth/**`, `/v3/api-docs/**`, `/swagger-ui.html`, `/swagger-ui/**`, `/h2-console/**`, `/actuator/health`
- All other requests require JWT authentication via `JwtAuthenticationFilter`
- Custom `CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint` and `CustomAccessDeniedHandler` for structured `ErrorResponse` on auth failures
- `OwnershipService` and `OwnershipValidator` are separate components enforcing resource ownership independently from permission checks

### 11.3 Swagger / API Documentation

- Swagger UI: `GET /swagger-ui.html`
- OpenAPI JSON: `GET /v3/api-docs/**`
- Both are publicly accessible (no auth required)

### 11.4 H2 Developer Console

- Path: `/h2-console`
- Publicly accessible in dev environment
- Database URL: `jdbc:h2:file:./data/digitalbankdb`
- Username: `sa`, Password: (empty)

### 11.5 Actuator

- `GET /actuator/health` — publicly accessible, returns service health status

### 11.6 Standing Order Execution Scheduler

Implemented in `StandingOrderExecutionJob`. Runs three scheduled jobs daily in UTC:

| Job | Cron | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `processOrders` | `1 0 0 * * *` (00:00:01 UTC) | Processes all ACTIVE orders where `nextRunDate` matches today. Marks insufficient-funds orders as `RETRY_PENDING` |
| `firstAttempt` | `0 0 8 * * *` (08:00 UTC) | Retries all `RETRY_PENDING` orders for today. Still-insufficient orders remain `RETRY_PENDING` |
| `finalAttempt` | `0 0 16 * * *` (16:00 UTC) | Final retry of `RETRY_PENDING` orders. Persistent failure sets status to `FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`, persists a `FAILED` transaction record, and triggers a mandatory `StandingOrderFailure` notification |

**Execution idempotency:** Each cycle uses a composite key `standingOrderId:nextRunDate` as the idempotency key stored in `idempotency_record`. A duplicate scheduler trigger for the same cycle performs no action.

**Account closure handling:** If the source account is not found at execution time, the standing order status is set to `TERMINATED` and no transaction is created.

**Holiday shifting:** `nextRunDate` is advanced to the next business day if it falls on a weekend or Canadian Bank Holiday (see §11.7). The frequency cycle is not affected.

**Scheduler thread pool:** Configured in `SchedulerConfig` with pool size 5, thread prefix `banking-scheduler-`, and graceful shutdown (`waitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown=true`).

### 11.7 Canadian Holiday Service

`CanadianHolidayService` provides holiday detection and next-business-day calculation. Hard-coded federal statutory holidays (non-year-specific rules):

| Holiday | Rule |
|---|---|
| New Year's Day | January 1 |
| Good Friday | 2 days before Easter (computed dynamically — Anonymous Gregorian algorithm) |
| Victoria Day | Last Monday before May 25 (Monday between May 18–24) |
| Canada Day | July 1 |
| Civic Holiday | First Monday in August (Monday on day 1–7 of August) |
| Labour Day | First Monday in September (Monday on day 1–7 of September) |
| Thanksgiving | Second Monday in October (Monday on day 8–14 of October) |
| Remembrance Day | November 11 |
| Christmas Day | December 25 |
| Boxing Day | December 26 |

### 11.8 Idempotency Purge Job

`IdempotencyPurgeJob` runs daily at **03:00 UTC** and purges:
- `idempotency_record` table entries older than `banking.idempotency.purge-after-hours` (default: `72`)
- `export_cache` table entries older than the same threshold

This purge does NOT affect transaction records, account records, audit logs, or statement data.

### 11.9 PDF Export Cache

`ExportCacheEntity` stores PDF bytes keyed by `(account_id, param_hash)`:
- `param_hash` is a SHA-based hash of the export request parameters (date range)
- On repeat identical export requests, the cached PDF is returned without regeneration
- Cache entries are purged after 72 hours by the `IdempotencyPurgeJob`

This mechanism ensures the transaction history PDF export is idempotent (identical requests return the same file).

### 11.10 Category Resolver

`CategoryResolver` assigns spending categories to transactions using case-insensitive keyword matching against the transaction description:
- Keywords are injected from application configuration under `banking.categories.<CategoryName>`
- First matching category wins
- Returns `null` (uncategorised) when no keyword matches
- Used at transaction creation time and referenced in spending insight calculations

### 11.11 Modulo 97 Validator

`Mod97Validator` implements the ISO 7064 MOD-97-10 algorithm for validating `payeeAccount` on standing orders:
- Input: 5–34 characters (after whitespace removal)
- Algorithm: moves first 4 chars to end, converts letters to digits (A=10…Z=35), computes MOD 97. Valid if remainder == 1
- Exposed as a `@ValidPayeeAccount` Bean Validation constraint annotation

### 11.12 Request Logging Filter

`RequestLoggingFilter` logs all incoming HTTP requests. Output goes to:
- Console (standard out)
- Log file: `logs/digital-banking.log`

Log levels: `ROOT=INFO`, `com.group1.banking=INFO`, `org.springframework.security=INFO`

### 11.13 Audit Service

`AuditService` persists an `AuditLogEntity` row on significant operations:

```java
auditService.log(actorId, actorRole, action, resourceType, resourceId, outcome);
```

Called by schedulers on execution outcomes, and should be called on all create/update/delete operations per the Data Retention and Audit Policy. Stored in `audit_log` table with indexes on `actor_id`, `resource_type + resource_id`, and `timestamp`.

### 11.14 Notification Preference Store

`NotificationPreferenceEntity` (table: `notification_preferences`) stores customer opt-in/out preferences per event type. The notification evaluation service reads these preferences when deciding whether to raise optional events. Mandatory events override preferences regardless of stored opt-out values.

## 18. OP-01 — Delete Customer

### Description

Deletes an existing customer when the customer has no active accounts. ADMIN only.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `DELETE`
- **Path:** `/customers/{customerId}`
- **Request Body:** None
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `409`

### Business Rules

- A customer can be deleted only if the customer exists and has no active accounts
- Deleting a customer removes the customer from normal operational use
- No implied account closure is performed by this operation
- Underlying records are retained per the 7-year retention policy

### Security Constraints

- Enforced by `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`

### Validation Rules

- `customerId` must be a valid numeric value greater than 0

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `customerId` format → `400`, `field="customerId"`
- Customer not found → `404`
- Customer has active accounts → `409`
- CUSTOMER caller → `401`

### Edge Cases

- Already deleted or non-existent customer → `404`
- Concurrent deletes → only one succeeds; subsequent return `404`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Success (200)
```json
{ "message": "Customer deleted successfully" }
```

#### Positive Scenario
- Given ADMIN caller and customer with no active accounts
- When DELETE is submitted with that `customerId`
- Then `200` and customer is removed from normal operational use

#### Negative Scenario 1
- Given no customer for the supplied `customerId`
- Then `404`

#### Negative Scenario 2
- Given customer with one or more active accounts
- Then `409`

#### Negative Scenario 3
- Given a CUSTOMER caller

- For `CHECKING`: `interestRate` must not be provided
- `accountNumber` is system-generated on creation *(implementation-derived)*
- `dailyTransferLimit` defaults to `3000.00` *(implementation-derived)*

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the specified customer (`user.getCustomerId().equals(customerId)`)
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Validation Rules

- `customerId` must be valid numeric > 0
- `accountType` required: `CHECKING` or `SAVINGS`
- `balance` required, non-negative, at most 2 decimal places
- For `SAVINGS`: `interestRate` required, non-negative, at most 4 decimal places
- For `CHECKING`: `interestRate` must not be present

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `customerId` format → `400`, `field="customerId"`
- Missing/invalid `accountType` → `400`, `field="accountType"`
- Missing/negative `balance` → `400`, `field="balance"`
- Customer not found → `404`

- Then `200` with account details

#### Negative Scenarios
- Non-existent account → `404`
- Invalid non-numeric `accountId` → `400`
- CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`

## 21. OP-04 — List Customer Accounts

### Description

Returns all active accounts belonging to a specific customer.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `GET`
- **Path:** `/customers/{customerId}/accounts`
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`

### Business Rules

- Customer must exist to list accounts
- Customer with no accounts returns `200` with empty list
- Response includes only active accounts (CLOSED accounts excluded from normal operational listing)

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the customer
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `customerId` format → `400`
- Customer not found → `404`
- Ownership failure → `401`

### Edge Cases

- Customer exists with no accounts → `200` with empty list (not an error)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario
- Customer with two accounts → `200` with both accounts

#### Negative Scenarios
- Non-existent customer → `404`
- Invalid `customerId` → `400`
- CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`

---

## 22. OP-05 — Update Account

### Description

Updates mutable account attributes while preserving account type constraints.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `PUT`
- **Path:** `/accounts/{accountId}`
- **Request Body:**
```json
{
  "interestRate": "BigDecimal (SAVINGS only)"
}
```
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `422`

### Business Rules

- Account must exist and have `status=ACTIVE`
- Only SAVINGS accounts expose a mutable field (`interestRate`) through this operation
- CHECKING accounts have no mutable fields exposed — any update request is rejected
- Immutable fields: `accountId`, `customerId`, `accountType`, `balance`, `createdAt`
- Successful update MUST refresh `updatedAt`

### Field Update Matrix

| Field | CHECKING | SAVINGS |
|---|---|---|
| `interestRate` | Not allowed | Updatable |
| All other fields | Not allowed | Not allowed |

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the account
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Validation Rules

- `accountId` valid numeric > 0
- Request body must contain `interestRate`; empty body is rejected
- Request body MUST NOT contain fields other than `interestRate`
- `interestRate` for SAVINGS: non-negative, at most 4 decimal places

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` → `400`
- Empty request body → `400`
- Unsupported/immutable field in body → `400`
- Account not found → `404`
- Negative/excess-precision `interestRate` → `422`, `field="interestRate"`
- `interestRate` for CHECKING → `422`, `field="interestRate"`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario
- Existing SAVINGS account with valid `interestRate` → `200` with updated details

#### Negative Scenarios
- CHECKING with `interestRate` → `422`
- Non-existent account → `404`
- CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`
- Immutable field in body (e.g. `balance`) → `400`

---

## 23. OP-06 — Delete Account

### Description

Closes an account when closure rules are satisfied.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `DELETE`
- **Path:** `/accounts/{accountId}`
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `409`

### Business Rules

- Account must exist
- Only accounts with `balance = 0.00` can be deleted
- Deletion sets `status=CLOSED`, sets `deletedAt` and `closedAt` timestamps *(implementation-derived)*
- Account is removed from normal operational access; underlying record is retained

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers can delete their own zero-balance accounts
- ADMIN callers can delete any zero-balance account

> **Note:** The original spec stated ADMIN only. The codebase service layer allows CUSTOMER to delete their own account provided the balance is 0.

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` format → `400`
- Account not found → `404`
- Non-zero balance → `409`
- CUSTOMER does not own account → `401`

### Edge Cases

- `balance=0.00` exactly → allowed
- Already deleted account → `404`
- Concurrent delete requests → first succeeds; subsequent return `404`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Success (200)
```json
{ "message": "Account deleted successfully" }
```

#### Positive Scenario
- ADMIN caller, account with `balance=0` → `200`
- CUSTOMER caller, own account with `balance=0` → `200`

#### Negative Scenarios
- Non-zero balance → `409`
- Non-existent account → `404`
- CUSTOMER does not own account → `401`

## 24. OP-07 — Deposit

### Description

Credits funds to an account and records the deposit transaction.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/accounts/{accountId}/deposit`
- **Headers:** `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (optional — `required = false` in implementation; behaviour defined when provided)
- **Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": "BigDecimal",
  "description": "string"
}
```
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `422`

### Business Rules

- Account must exist with `status=ACTIVE`
- `amount` must be > 0
- Successful deposit increases balance by `amount`
- Successful deposit → `Transaction` with `direction=CREDIT`, `status=SUCCESS`
- Failed deposit → `Transaction` with `status=FAILED`
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → return original outcome without re-applying balance change

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the account
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Validation Rules

- `accountId` valid numeric > 0
- `amount` > 0, at most 2 decimal places
- `Idempotency-Key` header: non-empty string (UUID recommended) when provided

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` format → `400`, `field="accountId"`
- Missing/non-positive `amount` → `422`, `field="amount"`
- Account not found → `404`
- Ownership failure → `401`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario
- Account balance `100.00` + deposit `25.00` → `200`, balance `125.00`, transaction `CREDIT / SUCCESS`

#### Negative Scenarios
- `amount = 0` → `422`, `field="amount"`
- Non-existent account → `404`
- CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → `200` with original response, no second balance change

## 25. OP-08 — Withdraw

### Description

Debits funds from an account and records the withdrawal transaction.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/accounts/{accountId}/withdraw`
- **Headers:** `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (optional — `required = false` in implementation)
- **Request Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": "BigDecimal",
  "description": "string"
}
```
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `409`, `422`

### Business Rules

- Account must exist with `status=ACTIVE`
- `amount` must be > 0
- Balance cannot become negative
- Successful withdrawal → `Transaction` with `direction=DEBIT`, `status=SUCCESS`
- Failed withdrawal → `Transaction` with `status=FAILED`
- Concurrent withdrawals evaluated against latest committed balance; later requests may fail if balance is insufficient after earlier ones commit
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → return original outcome

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the account
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` format → `400`
- Missing/non-positive `amount` → `422`, `field="amount"`
- Account not found → `404`
- Withdrawal would make balance negative → `409`
- Ownership failure → `401`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario
- Account balance `100.00` − withdraw `20.00` → `200`, balance `80.00`, transaction `DEBIT / SUCCESS`

#### Negative Scenarios
- Insufficient funds (balance `50.00`, withdraw `75.00`) → `409`, balance unchanged
- `amount = -5.00` → `422`, `field="amount"`
- CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → original response, no second balance change

## 26. OP-09 — Transfer Funds

### Description

Transfers funds from one account to another as a single atomic operation.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/accounts/transfer`
- **Headers:** `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (optional — `required = false` in implementation)
- **Request Body:**
```json
{
  "fromAccountId": "long",
  "toAccountId": "long",
  "amount": "BigDecimal",
  "description": "string"
}
```
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `404`, `409`, `422`

### Business Rules

- Both source and destination accounts must exist with `status=ACTIVE`
- `fromAccountId` and `toAccountId` must be different
- Source balance cannot become negative
- Transfer is **atomic**: both debit and credit succeed or neither applies
- Successful transfer → `DEBIT` transaction on source (`status=SUCCESS`) + `CREDIT` transaction on destination (`status=SUCCESS`)
- Failed transfer → transaction records with `status=FAILED`
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → return original outcome without re-applying

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: authenticated user extracted from `SecurityContextHolder`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the **source** account (`fromAccountId`). Destination ownership is NOT required
- ADMIN callers bypass ownership check

### Validation Rules

- Both `fromAccountId` and `toAccountId` valid numeric > 0
- `fromAccountId ≠ toAccountId`
- `amount` > 0, at most 2 decimal places

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `fromAccountId` or `toAccountId` format → `400`, `field` set to offending field
- Missing/non-positive `amount` → `422`, `field="amount"`
- `fromAccountId == toAccountId` → `422`, `field="toAccountId"`
- Source account not found → `404`
- Destination account not found → `404`
- Insufficient funds on source → `409`
- CUSTOMER does not own source → `401`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario
- Source `200.00`, destination `50.00`, transfer `75.00` → `200`, source `125.00`, destination `125.00`

#### Negative Scenarios
- Insufficient funds (source `30.00`, transfer `45.00`) → `409`, balances unchanged
- `fromAccountId == toAccountId` → `422`, `field="toAccountId"`
- CUSTOMER does not own source → `401`
- Duplicate `Idempotency-Key` → original response, no second balance change

- `amount > 0` and must not exceed `dailyTransferLimit`
- `payeeAccount` must pass Modulo 97 checksum (ISO 7064 MOD-97-10)
- Duplicate detection: identical ACTIVE order (same payeeAccount + amount + frequency) → `409 ERR_SO_DUPLICATE`
- Cancellation within 24 hours of `nextRunDate` → `403 ERR_SO_LOCKED`
- `endDate` passes → status set to `TERMINATED` by system
- Standing order execution: see §11.6 (Scheduler)
- Both SUCCESS and FAILED execution outcomes persisted as TRANSFER transactions

### Execution Lifecycle

## 29. US-10 — Evaluate Notification Event

### Description

Evaluates an incoming business event to determine whether a customer notification should be raised (RAISED), grouped (GROUPED), or suppressed (SUPPRESSED). Invoked by internal upstream event producers.

### HTTP Contract

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Path:** `/notifications/evaluate`
- **Authentication:** mTLS or API Key. Caller's `ServiceID` must be on the configured allow-list (`banking.notifications.allowed-service-ids`)
- **Request Body:**
  - `eventId` (UUID string, required) — used for deduplication
  - `eventType` (string, required) — must match a defined type in the Event Classification Matrix
  - `accountId` (long, required)
  - `customerId` (long, required)
  - `businessTimestamp` (ISO-8601, required)
  - `payload` (object, optional)
- **Expected Response Codes:** `200`, `400`, `401`, `409`, `422`

### Response Fields (200)

`eventId`, `decision` (RAISED/GROUPED/SUPPRESSED), `decisionReason`, `customerId`, `accountId`, `evaluatedAt`, `mandatoryOverride`

### Event Classification Matrix

| Event Type | Classification | Customer Preference Applies |
|---|---|---|
| `StandingOrderFailure` | Mandatory | No — always raised |
| `StatementAvailability` | Mandatory | No — always raised |
| `UnusualAccountActivity` | Mandatory | No — always raised |
| `StandingOrderCreation` | Optional | Yes — customer may opt out |

### Business Rules

- Mandatory events always produce a notification outcome, even if the customer has opted out
- Optional events are suppressed if the customer has opted out (per `NotificationPreferenceEntity`)
- Multiple events of the same type arriving close together may be grouped or suppressed — mandatory events must never be suppressed
- Every evaluation produces exactly one decision record (`NotificationDecisionEntity`)
- Duplicate `eventId` is detected, discarded, and returns `409`

### Security Constraints

- Caller authenticated via `ServiceApiKeyFilter` (API key, not JWT). `ServiceID` validated against allow-list (`banking.notifications.allowed-service-ids`)
- No JWT permission check is applied. This endpoint is not accessible via normal customer or admin JWT tokens

> **Note:** The original spec referenced `NOTIFICATION:READ` and JWT-based CUSTOMER/ADMIN roles. The codebase uses a separate security filter chain (`ServiceApiKeyFilter`) without any JWT permission enforcement on this endpoint.

### Error Mapping

- Malformed `eventId` → `400`, `field="eventId"`
- Missing `eventType` → `400`, `field="eventType"`
- Invalid `accountId` → `400`, `field="accountId"`
- Invalid `customerId` → `400`, `field="customerId"`
- Malformed `businessTimestamp` → `400`, `field="businessTimestamp"`
- Unauthenticated or unregistered ServiceID → `401`
- Duplicate `eventId` → `409`, `field="eventId"`
- Unknown `eventType` → `422`, `field="eventType"`
- `customerId` not linked to `accountId` → `422`, `field="customerId"`
- Customer not entitled → `422`, `field="customerId"`

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario 1 — Mandatory event always raised
- `200`, `decision=RAISED`, `mandatoryOverride=true` if customer had opted out

#### Positive Scenario 2 — Optional event, opted-in customer
- `200`, `decision=RAISED`

#### Negative Scenario 1 — Optional event, customer opted out
- `200`, `decision=SUPPRESSED`

#### Negative Scenario 2 — Duplicate eventId
- `409`, `field="eventId"`

#### Negative Scenario 3 — Unauthenticated caller
- `401`

#### Negative Scenario 4 — Missing required field
- `400`

#### Negative Scenario 5 — Unknown eventType
- `422`, `field="eventType"`

- `openingBalance`, `closingBalance`, `totalMoneyIn`, `totalMoneyOut`
- All transactions for the period (SUCCESS and FAILED), never truncated
- `versionNumber`, `correctionSummary` (on corrected versions), `generatedAt`

### Business Rules

- Statement covers a formally closed calendar month (`YYYY-MM`)
- `openingBalance` must match the closing balance of the prior period's issued statement
- An account with no activity still produces a statement with zero totals
- Corrections create a new version. Original is never overwritten
- Statements beyond the self-service retention window → `410`

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: `hasPermission(caller, "CUSTOMER_READ")` + ownership check
- CUSTOMER callers must own the account

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` → `400`, `field="accountId"`
- Invalid `period` format (not YYYY-MM) → `400`, `field="period"`
- Lacks `CUSTOMER_READ` permission → `401`
- CUSTOMER does not own account → `401`
- Account not found → `404`, `field="accountId"`
- No statement for period → `404`, `field="period"`
- Period not yet closed → `409`, `field="period"`

### Security Constraints

- Service layer authorization: `hasInsightsReadAccess` check — passes if the caller has authority `INSIGHTS:READ`, `CUSTOMER_READ`, or role `ROLE_ADMIN`; plus ownership check
- In practice, `INSIGHTS:READ` is never granted (not present in the `Permission` enum), so access is granted via `CUSTOMER_READ` (CUSTOMER and ADMIN roles) or `ROLE_ADMIN`
- CUSTOMER callers must own the account

### Error Mapping

- Invalid `accountId` → `400`, `field="accountId"`
- Invalid/missing `year` → `400`, `field="year"`
- Invalid/missing `month` → `400`, `field="month"`
- Invalid `transactionId` → `400`, `field="transactionId"`
- Account not found → `404`
- Transaction not found → `404`
- Unrecognised `category` → `422`, `field="category"`
- Lacks `CUSTOMER_READ` permission or `ROLE_ADMIN` → `401`
- CUSTOMER does not own account → `401`
- Month not yet started → `409`

### Edge Cases

- No eligible transactions → all eight categories zero, `totalDebitSpend=0.00` (not an error)
- All transactions disputed → `hasExcludedDisputes=true`, zero totals
- Account didn't exist for some trend months → those months show zero spend and `accountExisted=false`
- Current in-progress month → `isComplete=false`
- DEPOSIT recategorised → excluded from totals regardless (exclusion based on direction, not category)
- FAILED transaction recategorised → excluded from totals (exclusion based on status)

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Positive Scenario 1 — Month with eligible activity
- `200`, all 8 categories, percentages sum to 100, 6 trend entries, top 5 transactions

#### Positive Scenario 2 — Empty month returns zero totals
- `200`, all 8 categories with zero values

#### Positive Scenario 3 — Real-time recategorisation
- PUT with `category="Food & Drink"` → `200`, Shopping decreased, Food & Drink increased, all percentages still sum to 100

#### Positive Scenario 4 — Six-month trend always 6 entries
- Inactive months present with zero spend

#### Negative Scenario 1 — Lacks CUSTOMER_READ permission → `401`
#### Negative Scenario 2 — CUSTOMER ownership failure → `401`
#### Negative Scenario 3 — Account not found → `404`
#### Negative Scenario 4 — Unrecognised category ("Groceries") → `422`, `field="category"`
#### Negative Scenario 5 — Future month → `409`
#### Negative Scenario 6 — All transactions excluded → `200`, zero totals, `hasExcludedDisputes=true`
#### Negative Scenario 7 — Non-numeric accountId → `400`, `field="accountId"`

## 32. Security and Guardrails

### Forbidden Patterns — Never Do These

```
✗  Storing passwords in plain text
✗  Returning passwordHash in any response, log, or error message
✗  Hardcoding the JWT secret — read from environment variable only
✗  Committing .env or any secrets file to version control
✗  Using RestTemplate — use WebClient for any service-to-service calls
✗  Bypassing JPA with raw SQL
✗  Adding fields to a response not in the OpenAPI spec
✗  Using AI-suggested dependencies without a security audit
✗  Logging sensitive personal data or credentials
```

### Required `.gitignore`

```gitignore
.env
*.env
target/
*.class
application-local.properties
```

### Spring Boot Dependencies (pom.xml reference)

## 33. Definition of Done

A story is only done when **all** of the following are true:

| Category | Done When |
|---|---|
| BA Spec | User story, business rules, pre/postconditions, and acceptance criteria (positive + negative GWT) written and approved |
| Dev Spec | OpenAPI YAML in spec branch. Request/response tables complete. Implementation matches contract — no extra fields |
| QA | All test cases automated. 100% coverage via JaCoCo. Contract tests passing. All negative tests implemented |
| Guardrails | No forbidden patterns. Static analysis passed. Secret scanning passed. Dependency audit passed |
| Git | Feature branches only → PR → `develop`. Min 2 peer approvals. CI passing. Meaningful commit messages |
| Docs | OpenAPI YAML valid. Swagger UI renders correctly. README updated |
| Demo Ready | API running. Positive and negative paths demonstrated live. Contract tests shown passing. Guardrails explained |

### Git Workflow

```
feature/<story-name>   ← implementation + tests
      │
      ▼ (PR, 2 approvals, CI passing)
    develop
      │
      ▼
      qa  →  release  →  main
```

### Commit Message Convention

```
spec: defined acceptance criteria for <feature>
api:  implemented <endpoint>
api:  added <business rule> to <service>
test: added negative tests for <scenario>
test: added contract test for <response shape>
fix:  corrected <status code> response for <scenario>
docs: updated README with <endpoint> example
```

*This document is the merged source of truth for the Digital Banking Platform. It supersedes grp1.md, grp2.md, and grp3.md. Any change to endpoint contracts, error codes, JWT claims, or the data model must be updated here and re-approved before implementation begins. Section 11 (Implementation Infrastructure) documents behaviour found in the codebase that was not captured by any original spec file.*
